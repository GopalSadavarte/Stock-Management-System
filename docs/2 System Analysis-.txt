2 System Analysis:-

2.1 Existing System:
	The Stock Management System is solution of normal traditional paper based record keeping,employee management like there salary,attendance,etc are managed on paper and it difficult to manage and calculation are more complex and take it more time.
	
"The existing stock management system relies on traditional paper-based record-keeping. Employee management, including salary processing, attendance tracking, and other records, is maintained manually, making it difficult to manage. Calculations are complex and time-consuming, often leading to inefficiencies and errors."

2.2 Scope & Limitations:
Scope :
1.Stock Tracking â€“ Inventory levels are recorded manually, with updates based on physical verification.
2.Transperency - The records are maintained in front of others,there for the transperency and clearity are maintained.

Limitations :
1. Time-Consuming Processes - Manual entry and calculations slow down operations.

2. Error-Prone - Human errors in stock tracking, payroll calculations,            and attendance management are common.

3. Data Loss & Security Issues - Paper records are vulnerable to loss, damage, or unauthorized access.

4. Lack of Real-Time Updates - Stock and employee data are not updated instantly, leading to discrepancies.

5. Limited Scalability - As the organization grows, managing large amounts of data manually becomes impractical.

6. Difficult Report Generation - Preparing reports requires manual data compilation, which is inefficient and prone to mistakes.

2.3 Project perspective, features:
Introduction :

Purpose :
